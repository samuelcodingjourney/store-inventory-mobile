Assignment 7:
1. Stateless widget is when the state cannot be changed during the runtime of a Flutter application. So during the lifetime of the widget that has a stateless widget, the appearance and properties will not change. So in a way, these widgets are not dependent to other widgets. Stateful widget on the other hand is when some part of the interface will change during the program runtime. The widget can be drawn again multiple times. This is applicable when the part of the interface should change dynamically. 
2. On this mobile application, first widget that we use is called MyApp which is a stateless widget in main.dart. This widget is used to display the contents of the application using the home property. Inside this widget there are widgets of ThemeData and also MaterialApp. MaterialApp in this case is a widget it provides a wrapper around the material widgets so that the components and widgets provided by Flutter SDK. Widget BuildContext is called as an argument for build() method to build the widget of MyApp. ColorScheme widget here is used for colorscheme of the mobile applFication page. Colors widget is also used to get the color which is indigo in this case. MyHomePage stateless widget is also referenced here in the MyApp stateless widget attribute of home to display the contents of MyHomePage. In the menu.dart file we can see that there are widgets of ShopItem, MyHomePage that is stateless widget, Scaffold widget can be use to occupy the whole screen or the available space, AppBar widget contains the toolbar and other common action buttons usually its located at the top, Text to display text, SingleChildScrollView which is a widget which is a box where a widget can be scrolled, Padding which is a widget that adds padding or empty space around a widget or widgets, EdgeInsets which is a widget to control the area of a rectangle in four cardinal directions or for the four sides of the rectangle, Column is a widget taht arranges its chidl widgets in vertical way, TextAlign which is for aligning the text horizontally that is inside a parent widget's boundary, TextStyle can be used to customize the text widget, FontWeight to control the font weight of the text, GridView is a widget to display items in a two-dimensional way, ShopCard which is another stateless widget, Material widget to wraps widgets used for Material Design application, InkWell which can be used as a Button or a Gesture Detector, ScaffoldMessenger which is the widget used to store and manage SnackBar, SnackBar is a widget which will display at the bottom a brief message when a certain action had occured, Container which is mainly used for easier applying styling effects because those styling will be implemented to the child widgets of this container widget, Center which is a widget for centering the child to itself, MainAxisAlignment which is a widget to determine or manage the placement of the children along the main axis in a flex layout, and lastly Icon class or widget to show specific icons.  
3. To implement the steps for this assignment I needed to create a new flutter project and also initialize github so that I can connect from local directory to the GitHub directory. After setting up those, I needed to create a menu.dart file in the shopping_list/lib directory and importing material.dart in order to use what flutter can afford to. Also then I moved the class MyHomePage and class _MyHomePageState to the menu.dart file and then importing menu.dart inside main.dart. To create a simple widget in flutter, I needed to change the nature of the MyHomePage widget in the menu.dart from stateful to stateless. By adding the Widget build, creating the class to add text and cards by defining type by creating a new class of ShopItem then using it by creating a list of it and creating the objects of ShopItem which fills the text and icons needed for this assignment. Inside the Widget build method, there will be a code for displaying the view of the page which uses the widget Scaffold. This widget has attributes that differentiate parts of it for example the appBar and body attribute. I then needed to create a new stateless widget or class called ShopCard in order to display the cards. Finally, I performed git add, commit, and push.
